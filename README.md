## 🔧 Setup Instructions (Local Setup)
Follow these steps to set up and run the WebQuery project locally:
* Summarize steps:
1. Make sure you have docker installed.
2. clone the repo.
3. configure the .env with openai/gemini api keys in backend directory.
4. run `python indexing.py`
5. open any browser go to extensions and load the `extension` dir.

* Now your setup is done, the below ones are for running application
7. run `python chat.py`
8. in parallel run docker compose up (spinning up the docker to run qdrant db)

9. Then after go to chai_docs web site https://docs.chaicode.com/youtube/getting-started/ 
you will start notice a icon at bottom right.

📁 1. Clone the Repository
```bash

git clone https://github.com/sbndAbhijeet/WebQuery_RAG.git
cd WebQuery_RAG
```
### ⚙️ 2. Start the FastAPI Backend

Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash

cd backend
```
Run the FastAPI server:
```bash
python chat.py
Make sure your Python environment is activated and required packages are installed (pip install -r requirements.txt).
```
### 🐳 3. Start Qdrant with Docker
In a new terminal window (while backend is still running):

```bash

docker compose up
✅ Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running before this step.
```
### 🌐 4. View the Full HTML Demo

If you're testing the UI separately (outside the extension), right-click the index.html file and choose:

- "Open with Live Server" (VS Code extension recommended)


### 🧩 5. Load the Chrome Extension
Go to chrome://extensions

- Enable Developer Mode (top right)

- Click "Load Unpacked"

- Select the extension/ folder inside your project

The ChaiDocs Assistant icon will now appear in your toolbar

### 🚀 6. Use the Extension on ChaiDocs
Now, navigate to:
👉 https://docs.chaicode.com

You’ll see the assistant icon appear. Click it and start asking your queries directly on the docs page!


## ✨ Example Query Flow

1. Navigate to `https://docs.chaicode.com`
2. Click on the extension icon (bottom corner or popup)
3. Ask a question like:

   > "How do I use Tailwind CSS in Django?"

   > " How create a express app?"
4. You'll receive a detailed answer, code snippet (if any), and a link to the section.
